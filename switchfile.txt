1. Test Semaphore UI access:
   - From your Linux machine, try accessing Semaphore UI using the Windows host's IP address
   - Use a web browser and enter: `http://<windows_host_ip>:3000`

2. If Semaphore UI is now accessible:
   - We need to create a specific firewall rule to allow the traffic instead of keeping the firewall completely off

3. Create firewall rules:
   Re-enable the firewall:
   ```
   netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
   ```
   
   Then add rules for ICMP (ping) and Semaphore UI:
   ```
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4" protocol=icmpv4:8,any dir=in action=allow
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow Semaphore UI" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3000
   ```

4. Test again:
   - Try pinging from Linux to Windows
   - Try accessing Semaphore UI from Linux

5. If it's still not working with the firewall on:
   - We may need to adjust the rule or consider other factors like the WSL network configuration

6. WSL-specific considerations:
   - Ensure WSL is forwarding the port correctly to Windows
   - You might need to add a port proxy rule:
     ```
     netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=<WSL_IP>
     ```
     Replace <WSL_IP> with the actual IP of your WSL instance
